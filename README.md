# CAS502 PROJECT

## Title: 
Topological Data Analysis Visualizer

## Description:
This project develops a user-friendly tool for non-experts who want to assess whether their
time series data could benefit from persistence homology analysis. The tool prompts the user
to upload two sets of time series data (intended for comparison), validates the data, prompts
the user for a few parameters, and then subjects the validated data to a three-phase pipeline.
The first phase embeds the time series data into point clouds. The second extracts persistence
homology profiles from the point clouds. The third calculates a distance metric to assess the
topological similarites of the tw0 datasets. The tool outputs plots of the point clouds, 
persistence homololgy visualizations and the final distance metric.
